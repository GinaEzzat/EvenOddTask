# EvenOddTask
this task is written in dart to categorize the elements of the list to even and odd
first i initialized a list 
then made a forEach to iterate the list
to know whether the element is even or odd we check the remainder of dividing the elemnt by 2
the value of the remainder condition is saved in a variable named "type"
then i made a switch case over this variable
case 1 : if type == true, the number is even
case 2 : if type == false, the number is odd
